                <p> In September 2016, my husband, Tyler, and I went on a nine-day trip to
                    Europe. This was the first time either of us had been and it was
                    unforgettable. The following page highlights some of the places
                    we went, things we saw and food we ate! </p>

                <h2 class="article_head"> Dublin, Ireland </h2>
                <p> We kicked off their trip with 3 days in Ireland. It was a
                    beautiful country. The people are friendly, and the beer and
                    food are great. We packed a lot in to three days! Below are
                    some of the highlights.

                    </div>

                    <ul>
                        <li> Tour at the <a href="https://www.guinness-storehouse.com/en">Guiness Storehouse</a> where we learned to pour the purfect glass of Guiness. </li>
                        <li> Day trip up to Northern Ireland where we signed the Peace Wall in Belfast, hiked the formations at <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjopYz9t83RAhXHyVQKHZjnDV0QFggnMAE&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.giantscausewayofficialguide.com%2F&usg=AFQjCNEaq_mk1zLNoNHV-8nVq0QYE1VYMQ&sig2=3yOS4R4c_5s_AeNxno0ZjQ&bvm=bv.144224172,d.cGw">Giants Causeway</a>, and ventured across the Carrick-A-Rede bridge. </li>
                        <li> Partied Ireland style at our new favorite bar, Bruxelles. </li>
                        <li> Watched the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjW5rWYuM3RAhXJqlQKHXDKCu8QFggfMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gaa.ie%2Ffootball%2Fgaa-football-all-ireland-senior-championship%2Ffixtures&usg=AFQjCNFgd_KKGjP8VhyoGS-jrpL0Ehq56A&sig2=Wl2BNW0YUBY15d6DD8Udcw">Gaelic Football Champtionship</a> over lunch and drinks at O'Neills. </li>
                        <li> Explored the famous Temple Bar and finished the evening eating dinner at a pub near our hotel on Grafton Street. </li>
                    </ul>
                <p> Ireland sure was amazing. If traveling there, be sure to
                    bring &euro; Euro and &pound; Pound because the country
                    uses both currencies depending on where you visit. For sites to see, I would
                    definitely recommend taking a day trip to the countryside.
                    We chose to go north because of our interest in seeing Game
                    of Thrones sites, but there are SO MANY beautiful places to
                    go! I would also highly recommend drinking lots of Guiness
                    and cider, as well as eating fish 'n chips and Guiness Stew! </p>

                <h2 class="article_head"> London, England </h2>
                <p> Being there only one full day and two half days, London was
                    the shortest part of our trip. But, that didn't stop us from
                    packing in all of the touristy things we wanted to see and
                    do! Below are some of our favorites. </p>

                    </div>

                        <ul>
                            <li> Walked from our hotel to check out Westminster Abbey, Big Ben and Parliament - of course we had to find a red telephone booth on the way! </li>
                            <li> Took a trip around the <a href="https://www.londoneye.com/">London Eye</a> to see the entire city from above </li>
                            <li> Enjoyed a traditional English breakfast at the hotel and then found a good spot in the crowds to watch the changing of the guard. </li>
                            <li> The royal family leaves London in September, offering the abililty for tourists like us to tour the inside of Buckingham Palace! </li>
                            <li> Capped off the day with a full-service afternoon tea in the Oxford Street shopping district </li>
                            <li> Toured the royal jewel and armory collection at the <a href="https://www.hrp.org.uk/tower-of-london/">Tower of London</a> before heading off to our next European destination. </li>
                        </ul>
                <p> Something truly fascinates me about the history of the
                    United Kingdom. We made memories that will last a life
                    time and I still can't believe we had an opportunity to
                    tour Buckingham Palace! My first recommendation for
                    anyone going to London would be to go in September when
                    you can get an inside look at Buckingham Palace. The
                    weather was also pleasant and it was not considered high
                    tourist season. My second recommendation is to get an
                    <a href="https://oyster.tfl.gov.uk/oyster/entry.do">Oyster Card</a>
                    for the Tube - it made traveling the city increadibly easy.
                    Also, everwhere in the United Kingdom uses the &pound; Pound. </p>

                <h2 class="article_head"> Paris, France </h2>
                <p> Our last leg of the trip was to the romantic Paris. We took
                    a train from London to Paris, which was a really cool
                    experience. I was hesitant at first about the language
                    barrier since neither Tyler nor I speach French, so we
                    learned a few key words and went for it! Here are a few
                    key things we did. </p>

                    <div class="center">
                    <div class="container">
                        <img class="image2" src="https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/14691958_10105421794716771_7135242765261418148_o.jpg?oh=8fefee2e71d4bd57ef8a9db92e339725&oe=58D64912" width="200" />
                    </div>
                    <div class="container">
                        <img class="image2" src="https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/14570604_10105421797101991_6938589294700853574_o.jpg?oh=8adee1e34940bef9d6c57df77fbbe7a7&oe=590971B5" width="200" />
                    </div>
                    <div class="container">
                        <img class="image2" src="https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/14700992_10105421799861461_7424546122892558692_o.jpg?oh=bdca8f9e096d1ed10370d68bc6f545f1&oe=5912697E" width="200" />
                    </div>
                    </div>

                        <ul>
                            <li> First stop in Paris was a delicious dinner and wine at <a href="http://www.philippe-excoffier.fr/">Philippe Excoffier</a> followed by a night-time stroll under the Eifel Tower. </li>
                            <li> For the <a href="http://www.louvre.fr/en">Mus√©e du Louvre</a>, we purchased tickets online in advance and selected to go first thing in the morning - it was a good decision because we were able to see the Mona Lisa without a large crowd and spend the rest of our day enjoying the rest of the art. </li>
                            <li> The view of Paris at sunset atop the sairs of Sacre-Coeur is breathtaking and a must see before dining at one of the restaurants in Montmartre and then a show at <a href="http://www.moulinrouge.fr/?lang=en">Moulin Rouge</a>. </li>
                            <li> Paris chefs are known for their breakfast, and the crepes and omlets at Le Soleil d'Or near Notre Dame Cathedral did not dissappoint. </li>
                            <li> The self-guided tour of Notre Dame cathedral was informative and fun, plus the surrounding area is filled with cute shops. </li>
                        </ul>
                <p> Paris was amazing and we would definitely go back. The
                    culture is very relaxed and the people were not only nice,
                    but also extremely helpful. We encountered few people who
                    didn't know at least some English, and as long as we made an
                    effort to communicate, they were happy to help. When in
                    Paris, don't be afraid to try new things! Also, bring a good
                    pair of walking shoes and enough &euro; Euros to use public
                    bathrooms and to buy art from street vendors. There is so
                    much to see, do, eat and drink in Paris! </p>
