                <h1> Euro Trip 2016 </h1>
                <h4> By: Lindi Schaeffer </h4>
                <h5> January 16, 2017 </h5>
                <p> In September 2016, Lindi and Tyler went on a nine-day trip to
                    Europe. This was the first time either had been, and it was
                    unforgettable. The following page highlights some of the places
                    they went, things they saw and food they ate! </p>

                <h2> Dublin, Ireland </h2>
                <p> We kicked off their trip with 3 days in Ireland. It was a beautiful country. The people are friendly, and the beer and food are great. We packed a lot in to three days! Below are some of the highlights:
                    <ul>
                        <li> Tour at the Guiness Storehouse where we learned to pour the purfect glass of Guiness. </li>
                        <li> Day trip up to Northern Ireland where we signed the Peace Wall in Belfast, hiked the formations at Giants Causeway, and ventured across the carrick-a-rede bridge. </li>
                        <li> Partied Ireland style at our new favorite bar, Bruxelles. </li>
                        <li> Watched the Gaelic Football Champtionship over lunch and drinks at O'Neills. </li>
                        <li> Explored the famous Temple Bar and finished the evening eating dinner at a pub near our hotel on Grafton Street. </li>
                    </ul>
                <p> Ireland sure was amazing. For sites to see, I would
                    definitely recommend taking a day trip to the countryside.
                    We chose to go north because of our interest in seeing Game
                    of Thrones sites, but there are SO MANY beautiful places to
                    go! I would also highly recommend drinking lots of Guiness
                    and cider, as well as eating fish 'n chips and Guiness Stew! </p>

                <h2> London, England </h2>
                <p> Being there only one full day and two half days, London was
                    the shortest part of our trip. But, that didn't stop us from
                    packing in all of the touristy things we wanted to see and
                    do! Below are some of our favorites: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Walked from our hotel to check out Westminster Abbey, Big Ben and Parliament - of course we had to find a red telephone booth on the way! </li>
                            <li> Took a trip around the London Eye to see the entire city from above </li>
                            <li> Enjoyed a traditional English breakfast at the hotel and then found a good spot in the crowds to watch the changing of the guard. </li>
                            <li> The royal family leaves London in September, offering the abililty for tourists like us to tour the inside of Buckingham Palace! </li>
                            <li> Capped off the day with a full-service afternoon tea in the Oxford Street shopping district </li>
